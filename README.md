# Fizz Buzz Project

This is a simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Fizz Buzz challenge.

## How it works

- The program loops through numbers from 1 to 15.
- For each number:
  - Prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
  - Prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
  - Prints "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
  - Otherwise, prints the number itself.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```sh
   node Fizz-Buzz.js
   ```
